                <li>Each successful goal earns one point for the team. Players pass the puck among themselves, while the opposing team aims to prevent scoring.</li>

                <li><h3>Teams</h3>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each team can have up to 20 players, including two goaltenders, but only six players can be on the ice simultaneously. Substitutions are allowed at any time during the game.</li>
                <li><h3>Duration</h3>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp; The game consists of three periods, each lasting 20 minutes. The period length varies based on the level of play. The clock stops whenever play halts, emphasizing the importance of every second.</li>
                <li><h3>Playing Zones</h3>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hockey rink features red and blue lines. The red center line divides the ice into halves, while the blue line separates it into three zones: defending, attacking, and neutral.</li>
                <li><h3>Officiating</h3>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The referee, identified by a red armband, oversees the entire game and makes final decisions. Linemen handle offside calls, and goal judges determine if the puck crossed the goal line.</li>

                <br/>
                <h3>&nbsp;Faceoffs</h3>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;The game starts with a faceoff in the center circle. The referee drops the puck between opposing players, who battle for position. Faceoffs also resume play <br/> after stoppages in attacking or defending zones 
                <br/><br/>
                <h3>&nbsp;Physical Play</h3>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Players can use physical force to win the puck. Body checking is allowed <br/> but not above shoulder height or from behind.
                </p>

                <h3>&nbsp;Penalties </h3>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Minor penalties last two minutes, during which the penalized player leaves <br/> the ice. If the opposing team scores, the player can return immediately.<br/>
                Minor penalties include tripping, holding, hooking, and body checking <br/> without the puck.
                Major penalties result in a player’s removal for up to 5 <br/> minutes and may involve fighting or serious injury.
